		<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<p>Marvel’s <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts
			to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage,
			political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team.
			The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps—one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers
			to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark’s surprising decision
			to support government oversight and accountability.</p>
		<h3>Plot</h3>
			<p>In 1991, <strong>HYDRA</strong> operatives inside the Russian Armed Forces travel to their Siberian facility and revive the Winter Soldier
				from a cryogenic state. After using a set of conditioned trigger words to ensure the Winter Soldier's loyalty,
				Colonel Vasily Karpov orders him to intercept an automobile and execute its occupants.</p>
			<p>In the present, approximately one year after the Ultron Offensive,
				public opinion of the Avengers has become increasingly divided due to the events in <em>New York, Washington, D.C. and Sokovia.</em></p>
			<p>The team – which now consists of Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson and Wanda Maximoff –
				learn that former HYDRA sleeper agent Brock Rumlow, who now calls himself "<strong>Crossbones</strong>" plans to steal
				a biological chemical weapon from the Institute for Infectious Diseases in Lagos, Nigeria.
				After being cornered, Rumlow attempts to commit suicide with a bomb vest, trying to take Rogers with him in an act of revenge.
				Maximoff contains the explosion, but she loses control of her powers and inadvertently destroys a nearby building,
				killing several relief aid workers from <em>Wakanda</em>.</p>
			<p>At MIT, Tony Stark demonstrates a piece of technology aimed to recreate and relive old memories,
				and follows with a speech where he introduces a grant being awarded to all students,
				giving them all the proper funding to move forward with their own inventions and ideas. Before leaving the stage,
				he is shaken when the outdated autocue makes reference to Pepper Potts,
				whom he has broken up with over his refusal to give up being Iron Man. Outside,
				he is confronted by a grieving mother whose son was killed in the Avengers' battle with <em>Ultron in Sokovia</em>, whose story shakes Stark.</p>
			<p>One month after the incident in Lagos, Nigeria, in their headquarters, the Avengers are visited by Stark and Secretary of State,
				Thaddeus Ross, waiting for them. Ross explains that, due to the events in Lagos,
				the United Nations has decided they can no longer be allowed to operate privately. To that end,
				it has been decided that the Avengers will sign the Sokovia Accords, which will establish an international panel to control
				the Avengers' movements as well as monitor and police the rapidly growing number of enhanced individuals.</p>
			<p>The team is divided over the act; Stark supports government oversight because he feels guilty for his role in creating
				Ultron and the devastation Ultron caused. He also feels that the Avengers need to take more responsibility for the consequences
				of their actions, as he did when he discovered his company was secretly shipping weapons to terrorists.
				However, Rogers worries that the Avengers may be compromised if it comes under the control of a nefarious third party,
				such as the infiltration of <strong>S.H.I.E.L.D.</strong> by HYDRA.
				Ross states that refusing to sign the accords will be seen as an act of resignation.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, retired HYDRA operative Colonel Vasily Karpov is ambushed by <em>Helmut Zemo</em>,
				who asks for information regarding the 1991 mission. Karpov refuses, forcing Zemo to kill him.</p>
			<p>During their debate about the Accords, Rogers learns that Peggy Carter has passed away in her sleep and abruptly leaves
				for her funeral in London. While there, he learns Sharon Carter was Peggy's great niece as she delivers a eulogy about
				how one should never back down from what they believe in. This solidifies Roger's resolve not to sign the accords.
				Wanda finds herself confined to the New Avengers Facility by <em>Vision</em>,
				ostensibly for her safety since emotions are running high after what happened in Lagos.</p>
			<p>In Vienna, where the signing of the Accords is to take place, a terrorist bomb kills <em>King T'Chaka of Wakanda</em>.
				When security cameras reveal the suspect as Bucky Barnes, T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows revenge.
				Against Romanoff's advice, Rogers and Wilson decide to go behind Ross' back and bring in Barnes themselves.
				Following a tip-off by Carter, and a grueling chase, Barnes is captured, and Rogers, Wilson,
				and T'Challa are arrested for obstruction of justice.<a href = "plot.html"> See More ... </a></p>
